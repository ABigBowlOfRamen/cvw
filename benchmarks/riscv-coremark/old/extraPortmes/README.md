This directory is a backup for the portme files associated with cygwin, linux, and linux64

This backup is needed in the event that a user replaces the coremark directory with a clean version 
from EEMBC's github page (the clean version does not have the cygwin, linux,
and linux64 files that our version does).

Please do not delete this directory under any circumstance.
