# check for warnings in Verilog code
# The verilator lint tool is faster and better than Modelsim so it is best to run this first.

verilator --lint-only --top-module wallypipelinedsoc -Iconfig/rv64ic src/*/*.sv

# --lint-only just runs lint rather than trying to compile and simulate
# -I points to the include directory where files such as `include wally-config.vh  are found

# For more exhaustive (and sometimes spurious) warnings, run:
# verilator --lint-only -Wall -Iconfig/rv64ic src/*
# Unfortunately, this produces a bunch of UNUSED and UNDRIVEN signal warnings in blocks that are configured to not exist.
